# Smart Choices Weather App Frontend Development Plan

## Overview
A Next.js-based frontend application that connects to the existing Smart Choices Weather API to provide real-time weather data and forecasts based on the user's current location. The app emphasizes location verification to prevent spoofing or location mocking, ensuring users can only access weather data for their actual physical location. The application will utilize precise block-level location data rather than just city-level information.

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Create Next.js project
  - Initial setup with TypeScript
  - Configure ESLint, Prettier, and other code quality tools
- [ ] Set up project repository
  - Initialize Git repository
  - Configure branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches)
- [ ] Configure development environment
  - Install required dependencies
  - Set up environment variables
  - Configure proxy for API development
- [ ] Set up styling infrastructure
  - Install and configure Tailwind CSS or styled-components
  - Create global styles and theme configuration
  - Set up responsive breakpoints

## 2. API Integration
- [ ] Set up API client
  - Create API client utility for making requests to the existing Weather API endpoints:
    - `/weather/{city_name}` for current weather
    - `/forecast/{city_name}` for hourly forecast
  - Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
  - Add support for precise location parameters:
    - Pass latitude/longitude coordinates when available
    - Implement reverse geocoding to display neighborhood/block name
- [ ] Create data models
  - Create TypeScript interfaces for API responses
  - Build data transformation utilities for weather and forecast data
  - Build location data structures to store precise location information

## 3. Location Services
- [ ] Develop high-precision geolocation capabilities
  - Create geolocation service using browser API with high accuracy settings
    - Configure maximum precision (enableHighAccuracy: true)
    - Implement appropriate timeout and maximum age settings
    - Request continuous location updates when necessary
  - Implement IP-based location fallback (less precise)
  - Build location verification system
    - GPS accuracy verification (ensure accuracy < 100m for block-level precision)
    - IP address cross-validation
    - Browser Geolocation API integration
    - Timestamp validation for location requests
  - Create precise location change detection service
    - Detect smaller location changes (within same city but different blocks)
    - Implement distance calculation algorithms
- [ ] Implement location security
  - Add anti-spoofing detection algorithms
  - Create secure storage for cached location data
  - Build location verification workflows
  - Implement basic verification system
    - Compare GPS coordinates with IP-based location for significant discrepancies
    - Check accuracy readings from Geolocation API
    - Monitor for sudden location changes that aren't physically possible
    - Validate location precision meets requirements
- [ ] Create location permission handling
  - Develop permission request flow
    - Emphasize need for precise location access
    - Explain benefits of block-level weather information
  - Implement permission state management
  - Create permission denial experience
  - Build location settings UI
  - Develop clear user messaging
    - Explain why accurate location is needed
    - Provide transparency about location verification methods
    - Communicate precision level being used
