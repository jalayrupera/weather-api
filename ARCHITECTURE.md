# Architecture Overview for Smart Choices Weather App Frontend

## 1. Requirements Analysis

**Functional Requirements:**
- Display real-time weather and hourly forecasts based on the user's *block-level (precise)* location.
- Leverage existing backend endpoints (`/weather/{city_name}` for current weather and `/forecast/{city_name}` for hourly forecast), with enhancements to support latitude/longitude if available.
- Use the Browser Geolocation API for obtaining high-precision location data (with `enableHighAccuracy: true`).
- Fall back to IP-based geolocation when necessary, although with reduced precision.
- Perform basic location verification by ensuring GPS accuracy (< 100m), cross-checking with IP-based data, and validating timestamps of location requests.
- Allow users to choose between general (city-level) and precise (block-level) location display with clear messaging.
- Provide clear user guidance regarding location permissions and the importance of precision.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** Quick initial load (target < 3 seconds) and efficient rendering.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully responsive UI across devices.
- **Security & Reliability:** Robust error handling, anti-spoofing measures, and offline support via service workers.
- **Maintainability:** Modular, well-documented, and easily extensible architecture.
- **User Experience:** Smooth and transparent flow for location permission, error states, and privacy messaging.

## 2. System Context Examination

- **Backend Weather API:** Provides weather and forecast information; already in place with Redis caching.
- **Browser Geolocation API:** Primary means to obtain high-precision user location.
- **IP-based Geolocation:** Serves as a fallback but is less precise (especially with VPN use).
- **Reverse Geocoding Service (Optional):** To convert latitude/longitude into a block/neighborhood name for display.
- The frontend will operate as a client-side application with offline support and performance optimizations.

## 3. Architecture Design

### Recommended Architecture (Hybrid Approach):
- **Framework:** Next.js (leveraging both Server-Side Rendering for static content and Client-Side Rendering for user-specific data).
- **Client-Side Location Services:** 
  - **Location Provider:** A dedicated React Context that handles high-precision geolocation requests (with `enableHighAccuracy: true`), falling back to IP-based methods if necessary.
  - **Verification:** Basic verification using GPS accuracy (< 100m), IP cross-check, and timestamp validation.
- **API Client Module:** Encapsulates fetching of weather and forecast data from the existing backend API. Enhanced to include precise location parameters when available.
- **UI Components & State Management:**
  - Structured, modular components for current weather, forecast timeline, settings, and error states.
  - Global state management using React Context and custom hooks to manage location and weather data.
- **Offline Support & Performance:**
  - Use of service workers (e.g., via Workbox) for caching API responses and assets.
  - Code-splitting and lazy loading to optimize performance.

## 4. Technical Specification

**Technologies:**
- **Framework:** Next.js with React & TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (or styled-components) for responsive design
- **State Management:** React Context with custom hooks
- **API Client:** Fetch/Axios with error handling and retry logic
- **Offline Support:** Service workers for caching (Workbox)
- **Deployment:** Platforms such as Vercel for serverless deployment along with CI/CD integrations
- **Optional:** Reverse geocoding integration (Google Maps, Mapbox) for translating coordinates to human-readable locality names

**Component Breakdown:**
- **LocationProvider:** Manages geolocation, provides high-accuracy location data, and validates against IP data.
- **WeatherDisplay:** Renders current weather details using data fetched by the API client.
- **ForecastTimeline:** Shows hourly forecast in a scrollable timeline with micro-climate details.
- **Settings:** Allows users to toggle between precise and general location, change temperature units, and view permission instructions.
- **ErrorBoundary:** Catches and handles unexpected UI errors.

## 5. Transition Decision & Implementation Roadmap

**Summary:**
- Build a Next.js frontend that leverages high-precision geolocation via the browser API and verifies the location using basic methods (GPS accuracy, IP cross-check, timestamp validation).
- Enhance the API client to support precise location data, and update UI components to display block-level location information.
- Emphasize clear user messaging and settings options so users understand the benefits and trade-offs of precise location access.

**Implementation Roadmap:**
1. **Project Setup:** Initialize Next.js project, setup repository, configure environment, and styling.
2. **Develop API Client:** Create modules for API interaction and data transformation, considering latitude/longitude parameters.
3. **Implement Location Service:** Build a LocationProvider with high-precision geolocation and basic verification logic.
4. **UI and Component Development:** Create weather display, forecast timeline, settings, and error components.
5. **Integration & Optimization:** Connect services, implement offline support, and optimize performance (lazy loading, caching).
6. **Deployment:** Set up CI/CD, deploy to production, and monitor performance.

**Final Confidence:** 95%
