# PRD: Weather App Frontend with Location Security

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: Weather App Frontend with Location Security
- Version: 1.0.0

### 1.2 Product summary
This product is a Next.js-based frontend application that will connect to an existing Smart Choices Weather API. The app will provide real-time weather data and forecasts based on the user's current location, with an emphasis on location verification to prevent spoofing or location mocking.

The frontend will focus on presenting weather information in an intuitive, user-friendly manner while implementing strong security measures to ensure location data accuracy. This will prevent users from accessing weather data for locations other than their actual physical location.

### 2.2 User goals
- Access accurate, real-time weather data for their current location
- View detailed forecasts to plan activities
- Quickly understand current weather conditions at a glance
- Experience minimal friction when granting location permissions
- Receive reliable weather alerts and notifications when relevant

### 2.3 Non-goals
- Allow users to search for weather in locations other than their current position
- Build a weather API (already exists)
- Support historical weather data
- Provide weather maps or radar imagery
- Create a native mobile application (web app only at this stage)
